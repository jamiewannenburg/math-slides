# Test Animation {data-x="1024" data-y="-768" data-scale="1"}

When you arrive at the slide, 

the animation is triggered

(unless you are in beamer)

* This is an itemized list
* To the right is a lattice

1) This is an enumerated list
2) Use arrows to move between slides
3) You can see the previous slide from the next slide

::: notes
Some notes in *markdown*.

One can create new lines as above to create space.

Slides start at the title of # symbol and end at the dashes.

Note that beamer does not play the animation.

Thm
:    In the join of the six covers of $\overline{\mathbf{C_4}}$ within $\mathsf{M}$, every subquasivariety is a variety.
\
\

$p, p \to q \vdash_{\mathbf{R^t}} q$
:   Suppose that $e \leq p$ and $e \leq p \to q$. By the law of residuation $p \leq q$, then $e \leq q$, by the transitivity of $\leq$.
\
\

## Thm

An alternative that goes with a proof

### Proof

It is self evident.

:::: column
Keeping a 'fixed' floating image.

Suppose this is a long proof.

And I want to keep the picture around as I continue with the proof.
